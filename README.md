# Purpose
The project does a simulation about the virus spread in different situations, WITH/WITHOUT the lockdown practice.

# Execution
That's not required any extra dependency, you just have to start the program via IDE or command line


# Initial screen
The user can choose two options:
- 100 health people and 1 sick (without lockdown pratice)
- 9 health people and 1 sick (with lockdown practice)

# Simulation
- Each sick person has 30 seconds to go to the hospital, otherwise it dies.
- In case of overlapping between sick and health person, the last gets sick.

The simulation works as shown in the image below
